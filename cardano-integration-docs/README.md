## Technologies Used

- **Cardano** - Main blockchain platform for integration
- **Mesh Smart Contract Library** - Primary SDK for Cardano blockchain integration
- **Lucid Evolution** - Transaction building library for Cardano
- **Blockfrost** - API provider for Cardano blockchain data and IPFS functionality

## Getting Started

To begin working with this integration, start by reviewing the lacking features and blockchain integration documents. This will provide a clear understanding of the current state and the intended improvements.

```bash
# Install required Cardano dependencies
npm install @meshsdk/core @meshsdk/react @blockfrost/blockfrost-js @lucid-evolution/lucid
```

## Repository Structure

The integration code will be organized as follows:

```

└── utils/
    └── ipfs/         # Utilities for IPFS interactions
```

## Integration Summary

This documentation provides a comprehensive plan for integrating Cardano blockchain functionality into the MedFund application. The key components of the integration include:

1. **Blockchain Context and Wallet Connection** - Setting up the core infrastructure for interacting with the Cardano blockchain and connecting to users' wallets.

2. **IPFS Integration** - Using IPFS for storing campaign data, medical documents, and verification attestations in a decentralized manner.

3. **Smart Contract Integration** - Implementing smart contracts for campaign management, verification, governance, and rewards without directly writing contract code.

4. **Additional Features** - Adding native token rewards, staking mechanisms, multi-signature transactions, and other Cardano-specific features to enhance the platform.

5. **Implementation Timeline** - A detailed 9-week plan for implementing all aspects of the integration, including risk management strategies.

The integration will transform MedFund into a transparent, secure, and trustworthy platform for medical crowdfunding by leveraging the strengths of blockchain technology.
