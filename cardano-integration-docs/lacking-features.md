# Lacking Features

This document outlines the features that are currently lacking in the MedFund platform and could be significantly improved through Cardano blockchain integration.

## Identity and Verification

- **Decentralized identity verification** for users, campaign creators, and medical institutions
- **Verifiable credentials** for medical professionals and institutions
- **Transparent verification processes** with immutable evidence and attestations

## Fund Management

- **Blockchain-based transparent fund tracking** to allow donors to see where their money goes
- **Immutable campaign and donation records** to prevent tampering or fraud
- **Multi-signature approval process** for fund disbursement to ensure proper use of funds

## Data Storage and Security

- **Secure storage for medical documents** and verification data using IPFS and encryption
- **Access-controlled sharing** of sensitive medical information
- **Immutable audit trail** for all document access and modifications

## Governance

- **Decentralized governance mechanisms** for fund allocation decisions
- **Community voting** on campaign verification and fund disbursement
- **Transparent decision-making processes** with on-chain voting records

## Incentives and Rewards

- **Tokenized rewards system** for contributors and campaign supporters
- **Staking mechanisms** to incentivize long-term platform participation
- **Reputation systems** for medical institutions and verification entities

## Transparency and Tracking

- **Real-time tracking of fund utilization** with blockchain-based attestations
- **Direct verification** of fund disbursement to medical service providers
- **Milestone-based fund release** tied to treatment progress

## Wallet Integration

- **Direct wallet integration** for donations and withdrawals
- **Seamless transaction experience** for users unfamiliar with cryptocurrency
- **Multi-currency support** for donations in different tokens

## Implementation Considerations

Each of these lacking features presents an opportunity for enhancement through blockchain integration. The implementation will focus on addressing these gaps while maintaining a user-friendly experience, particularly for users who may not be familiar with blockchain technology.

The integration will use a combination of:
- On-chain transactions for financial operations and attestations
- IPFS storage for documents and larger data sets
- Smart contracts for automated governance and fund management
- Wallet integration for seamless user experience
